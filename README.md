# ProjectManagement
A collection of simple scripts for managing all of your projects.
Just place the project.sh and .bashrc_template in any folder where you want to store your project files.

Add an alias like
```
alias project='bash -c "PATH/project.sh"'
```
Now you can go into your projects from anywhere by just typing
```
projects
```
